<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Kotak Education Foundation (KEF) is an NGO operating in the space of education and livelihood since 2007. Its primary focus is to help poor children and youth to be empowered through education and livelihood respectively. <br/> <br/>
A major hurdle with the management of such a vast range of activities and people from different backgrounds, especially remotely, was that there was no efficient way set up to communicate details about various activities from Volunteers to Beneficiaries and vice-versa. Being that both Volunteers and Beneficiaries generally come from non-technical backgrounds, several tasks, like filling important forms regularly, became quite inconvenient and unnecessarily complicated, which hindered the efficiency of the programmes. The KEF Members had to manually call each volunteer and beneficiary to inform them of the upcoming scheduled activities and sessions, and then call them again for their feedback on whatever activity they conducted or attended.
<br/> <br/>
As interns, our methodology for solving this critical problem was simple - we created a mobile application that serves as a one-stop for both Volunteers and Beneficiaries, as well as any third party Intervention managers. This application consists of the several forms that were previously spread out across various links, and allows a user to find what they want easily. The app also allows new members to Sign Up and Join the KEF as either a Volunteer or a Beneficiary.
<br/><br>
<strong>This repository contains the code for the front-end of the application, written in React Native. The code for the back-end is available [here](https://github.com/shameekbaranwal/KEF-API).</strong>
